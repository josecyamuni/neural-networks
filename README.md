# Image classification
This project was the final assignment of the **Neural Network Design and Deep Learning** course, where we compared various approaches to image classification by evaluating both machine learning and deep learning models trained using TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn. The projectâ€™s findings were documented in articles published on Medium.
